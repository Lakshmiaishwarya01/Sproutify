## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank everyone who supported us in the development of this project. Special thanks to our mentor Er. Anju V Abraham, for providing expertise and guidance throughout the project. We also extend our gratitude to anyone who has helped us in any way.


## Introduction

The **Fully Automated Smart Garden System** integrates **IoT** and **Machine Learning (ML)** for plant care. This system monitors real-time sensor data, including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and nutrient levels (NPK). It uses a **linear regression model** to predict the ideal time for watering and nutrient delivery, which is then automatically executed by pumps.

This project leverages the **ESP32** microcontroller to process sensor data and control the system via Firebase, offering a **mobile app** for users to monitor their garden remotely.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a smart system that automates watering and nutrient delivery to plants based on environmental and soil conditions. The system's predictive model ensures that plants receive the correct amount of water and nutrients at the right time, promoting healthier growth and reducing manual intervention.

## Deliverables

* **IoT Integration**: Integration with Firebase for real-time data exchange and control.
* **Machine Learning Model**: A model predicting the required watering and nutrient delivery times.
* **Mobile Application**: A mobile app to monitor and interact with the garden system remotely.
* **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI for tracking plant conditions and system status.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

* **Sensor Data**: Temperature, humidity, moisture, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium values from soil sensors.
* **Pump Actions**: Control commands (ON/OFF) sent to pumps based on the sensor data and model predictions.

## Models

* **Linear Regression Model**: Predicts the required action (water or nutrient) based on real-time sensor data.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the accuracy of its predictions, comparing the actual outcomes with predicted results to determine how effectively the system responds to changing conditions.

## User Interfaces

* **Mobile App**: Allows users to view real-time data from their plants, receive notifications, and manually adjust settings.
* **Admin Dashboard**: For system monitoring, providing insights into plant health and system status.

## Conclusion

The **Fully Automated Smart Garden System** is an effective IoT and ML solution for smart gardening. It reduces the effort involved in plant care and ensures that the plants receive timely and optimal water and nutrients. The integration of a mobile app makes the system more user-friendly, enabling users to monitor and control the garden remotely.
